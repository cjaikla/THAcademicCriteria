Need to show how to get csv file for all researcher ID that we want to download

Here's a code to use API key for downloading user data from Scopus (insert code here and edit this code for batch download):

{% highlight python linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
